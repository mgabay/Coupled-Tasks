Coupled-Tasks
=============

Unorganized research code dedicated to the identical coupled-task
scheduling problem.

The code in this repository are related to some work on the identical
coupled-tasks scheduling problem done during my master's and my PhD thesis.

The code provided here is mostly research code written for my own usage
and hence is poorly docummented and non-generic.

conference slides). One chapter will be dedicated to this problem in
my PhD thesis.
