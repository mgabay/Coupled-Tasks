Coupled-Tasks
=============

Unorganized research code dedicated to the identical coupled-task scheduling problem.

The code in this repository are related to some work on the identical coupled-tasks scheduling problem done during my master's and my PhD thesis.

The code provided here is mostly research code written for my own usage and hence is poorly docummented and non-generic.
