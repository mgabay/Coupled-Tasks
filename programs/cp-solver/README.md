IDCT -- CP Solver
=================
Constraint programming solver for the coupled-task scheduling problem.

Modify the main file for proper execution. Use the CTSolver to solve a general
coupled-task scheduling problem and the IdSolver to solve an instance of the
identical coupled-task scheduling problem.

The solver is not optimized. Especially, no dedicated heuristic is implemented
for variable selection and branching.

Dependencies
------------
This project uses Choco 2 as a constraint programming solver.
